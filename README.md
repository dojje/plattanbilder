# plattanbilder

There is a website where you can look at [sergels torg *(link to wikipedia)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergels_torg) live.

[Click here](http://www.webbkameror.se/webbkameror/sergelstorg/) to go to the website with the live images.

This is a script that will download an image every hour. With theese images you can make a timelapse and that is what this script does.
The reason for the name "plattanbilder" is because sergels torg is sometimes called plattan and bilder means images in swedish.
